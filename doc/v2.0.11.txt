FIX: #341
---------
Add person as a friend even if invite sms is not sent.

PROBLEM:
Currently if the user cancels just at the point of sending the invite sms we do not add the friend. This is a problem because user may wish to still add the friend but let him know about the app another way.

SOLUTION:
After user cancels at the last moment before sending an sms present dialog regarding sms not sent. But still add the friend show the friend added dialog and allow him to send a welcome message as usual.

Cases: (Testrail)
c38 - Invite sms cancel
c2446 - No sim card IOS
c2447 - No sim card Android
c47 - Nudge - sms send
c46 - Nudge - sms cancel

FIX #344:
---------
In the case where we user picks a contact with multiple numbers always show select phone number dialog even if any or all phone numbers are currently freinds.

In 2.0.10 we dont do this and it makes it impossible to add a friend with the correct number if you have added a friend with an incorrect number beforehand.

Kon bug:
- Add user with single bad line like land line.
- Add a good mobile number to the contact.
- Try to add the person again. It assumes you are connected and doesnt give you the choice to pick the new line.
