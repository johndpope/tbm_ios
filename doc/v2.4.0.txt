hotfix/874-first-recording-after-reg
------------------------------------
Symptoms:
  1 Invite a user
  2 Send invite sms but no sim
  3 Notification from OS that no sim causes app to resign active
  4 Send welcome message
  ERROR: Video recorder never completes recording.

CAUSE:
  We deactivate audio session when we resign active to allow other apps to use the audio
  When we deactivate the audio session while preview is still showing we get an error
  Attempting to record when we become active again after this error fails

SOLUTION:
  Stop preview on applicationWillResignActive
  Start preview on applicationDidBecomeActive
  Give stop preview some time to complete before deactivating audio session.
