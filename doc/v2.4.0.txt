v2.4.0


fix/camera
----------

Video Recorder TODO:
- Must fix
  - Interruption corner cases
    - Start Zazo when mic or camera is taken by another app (phone call)
    - Phone call while Zazo running return to Zazo while in call
    - Phone call while recording.
  - Video size, resolution, bit rate etc.
    - Probably requires fork of PBJVision

- Nice to fix
  - Delegate rather than blocks for callbacks
  - Move UI messages out of VideoRecorder
  - Move 2 finger touch recognizer out of VideoRecorder
  - No direct calls of VideoRecorder from ZZGridCellViewModel
  - Create a GridPresenter+VideoRecorder category



 - Remove wasRecordingStopped
   - Change resolution
   - Change front camera

 - Remove callbacks and use delegate instead
   - What are callbacks used for now?

   - Decide what is the minimum delegate methods.

 - Remove handle incoming call.
 - Remove unused from zzdevicehandler



Questions:
  - Why does ZZVideoRecorder handleTouches? It seems like a hack to cancel on 2 finger touch. Should I remove this and handle elsewhere? In ZZGridCellViewModel?
   - If we move it would better in presenter. In a separate category.

  - The ZZVideoRecorder should really not update any UI including toasts. Correct? I think at most it should notify of events that may require toasts such as videoTooShort and something else should cause these toasts. Correct? Which object should properly present these toasts?
    - Prestenter UserDialogsCategory.


  - Why does ZZGridCellViewModel._checkIsCancelRecordingWithRecognizer call ZZVideoRecorder.cancelRecording. Shouldnt it call its dataSourceDelegate for this which should then call the presenter?
     - Add a category on presenter to handle video recorder stuff.






  - VideoRecorder unit test.
