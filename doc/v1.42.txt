RELEASE NOTES
=============

v1.42 - 12 - 9/16/2014
----------------------

BUG: Camera does not come up after registration.
FIX: Rework logic for instantiating videoRecorder. Dont use appDidBecomeActive.


v1.421 - 13 - 9/16/2014
-----------------------

BUG: More cases where camera doesnt come up. 
FIX: Still need to use appDidBecomeActive because in some scenarios videoRecorder appears to be gone, yet when we come into the foreground we get appDidBecomeActive but no viewDidAppear. 
TRY: AppDidBecomeActive && if (self.isViewLoaded && self.view.window) 


BUG/FEATURE: After completing registration download any pending that were sent prior to registration.

v1.422 - 14 9/16/2014
---------------------

BUG: Still more cases where camera doesnt come up. I believe the case is when the os kills the view from under the viewController but the videoRecorder instance is preserved. 
TEST FIX: reinstantiate unless (self.videoRecorder != nil && retryCount == 0  && [self isViewLoaded] && self.view.window)


v1.423 - 15 9/18/2014
---------------------

BUG: Crash on startup. 
CAUSE: We lose obTasks but we dont lose the underlying nsTask. As a bandaid we set up a new obTask when we detect that. However when the dangling nsTask completes FTM cant find an obTask for it. Right now this causes a crash.
BANDAID FIX: Detect and ignore when we get an nsTask completing and we cant find an oBTask for it. Both in upload and download.


v1.424 - 16 9/26/2014
---------------------

FEATURE: Link on plus sign to send an email to add friend.

UPDATE: Fix calls to new notification api for IOS8.
