BUGS
- Kill in the task manager then try to restart. Does not always start. Sometimes dies and goes away. Sometimes get stuck on screen with all + signs for friends.
  - Boot should happen before a lot of the other stuff we do. It should be a category on appDelegate not a category on homeViewController.
- Downloading sometimes continues to show in the case where FTM has obTasks in the processing state but no nsTasks associated with them.
- No thumbnail sometimes


ARCHITECTURE
