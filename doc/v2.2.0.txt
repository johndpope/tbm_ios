General Notes:
=============

The main issue addressed in this release AudioSession handling. Zazo should now play nicely with bluetooth and with other audio apps.

If music is playing from a music app when Zazo is brought to the foreground it will pause. When Zazo is returned to the background music will resume.

In a car system if the radio is playing and you bring Zazo to the foreground it should stop. When you return to the background radio should resume.

If you are playing a Zazo and you hold the phone to your ear the message should play from the earpiece. When you remove from ear it should continue playing through the speaker.

General corner cases
--------------------
You should be able to try all combinations of:
- Receiving phone calls while recording or playing zazos on or off of bluetooth
- Receiving zazo while listening to radio in car but with bluetooth connected
- Playing and recording zazos while music streaming through bluetooth in car
- Moving phone to and away from ear repeatedly while playing a zazo.
- etc etc.

TEST CASES
==========
c81 - switch speakers with proximity sensor
c76-79, c2455, c2479 - bluetooth, wiredheadphones, carsystem etc.


v2.2.1
------

BUG:
In car with HFP it acts like the app  is in a phone call the entire time. Also it attempts to use the car's mic and if there is a problem it fails to record.

SOLUTION:
Eliminate play from bluetooth. Just play from phone but try to resume music.


BUG:
Closing the app with player running or even just because recorder is previewing causes a audioSession:deactivate to produce an error. All io must be stopped before deactivating the audio session.

SOLUTION:
Stop AVRecordingSession and VideoPlayer prior to calling AudioSession:Deactivate

BUG: #459 Open Zazo while on phone call
---------
Open Zazo while on the phone causes repeated retries and errors to activate AVCaptureSession
