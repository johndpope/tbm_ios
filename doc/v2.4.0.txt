Questions:
  - Why does ZZVideoRecorder handleTouches? It seems like a hack to cancel on 2 finger touch. Should I remove this and handle elsewhere? In ZZGridCellViewModel?

  - The ZZVideoRecorder should really not update any UI including toasts. Correct? I think at most it should notify of events that may require toasts such as videoTooShort and something else should cause these toasts. Correct? Which object should properly present these toasts?

  - Why is ZZGridPresenter setting ZZVideoRecorder.isRecorderActive. Shouldn't ZZVideo recorder know and handle its own state?

  - Why does ZZGridCellViewModel._checkIsCancelRecordingWithRecognizer call ZZVideoRecorder cancelRecording. Shouldnt it call its dataSourceDelegate for this which should then call the presenter?

  - Should I delete ZZGridStateView.checkIsCancelRecordingWithRecognizer? It seems that this is handled by ZZGridCelViewModel now and is not correct in ZZGridStateView?

  - The ZZGridDataSource sitting between the views and the presenter seems like a bit of a pain. Is it really necessary?
