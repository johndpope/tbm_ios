Questions:
  - Why does ZZVideoRecorder handleTouches? It seems like a hack to cancel on 2 finger touch. Should I remove this and handle elsewhere? In ZZGridCellViewModel?
   - If we move it would better in presenter. In a separate category.

  - The ZZVideoRecorder should really not update any UI including toasts. Correct? I think at most it should notify of events that may require toasts such as videoTooShort and something else should cause these toasts. Correct? Which object should properly present these toasts?
    - Prestenter UserDialogsCategory.

  - Why is ZZGridPresenter setting ZZVideoRecorder.isRecorderActive. Shouldn't ZZVideo recorder know and handle its own state?
     - Oksana will check.

  - Why does ZZGridCellViewModel._checkIsCancelRecordingWithRecognizer call ZZVideoRecorder.cancelRecording. Shouldnt it call its dataSourceDelegate for this which should then call the presenter?
     - Add a category on presenter to handle video recorder stuff.






  - VideoRecorder unit test.
