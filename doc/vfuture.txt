BUGS
- Swipe away while recording should show not sent indicator.
- Kons messages sometimes coming in as 404? Check server state?
- Still a case where I get a grey screen. It looks like appDelegate.applicationDidBecomeActive is being called but it is not calling HomeViewController.appDidBecomeActive. Is it possible that appDelegate.homeViewController is pointing to a stale instance and the HomeViewController was just reinstantiated by the system. I should probably find a way to point to the active homeViewController if any rather than instantiate one.

ARCHITECTURE
- VersionController should probably be a category on appDelegate not HomeViewController
