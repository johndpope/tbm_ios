    x Probably requires fork of PBJVision

  x PBJVision
    x Update npb fork of the pod
    x Push
    x Install pods

- Nice to fix
  x Clean up notifications.
    x Remove existing notifications
    x Add one for didStartVideoCapture and didStopVideoCapture

  x No direct calls of VideoRecorder from ZZGridCellViewModel

  x Remove handle incoming call.
  - Remove unused from zzdevicehandler

  - Delegate rather than blocks for callbacks
  - Move UI messages out of VideoRecorder
  - Move 2 finger touch recognizer out of VideoRecorder
  - Create a GridPresenter+VideoRecorder category
  - Move switch camera icon up.

- Testcases
  - List testcases in this doc
  - Create a testplan for all of the above




 - Remove handle incoming call.
 - Remove unused from zzdevicehandler



Questions:
  - Why does ZZVideoRecorder handleTouches? It seems like a hack to cancel on 2 finger touch. Should I remove this and handle elsewhere? In ZZGridCellViewModel?
   - If we move it would better in presenter. In a separate category.

  - The ZZVideoRecorder should really not update any UI including toasts. Correct? I think at most it should notify of events that may require toasts such as videoTooShort and something else should cause these toasts. Correct? Which object should properly present these toasts?
    - Prestenter UserDialogsCategory.


  - Why does ZZGridCellViewModel._checkIsCancelRecordingWithRecognizer call ZZVideoRecorder.cancelRecording. Shouldnt it call its dataSourceDelegate for this which should then call the presenter?
     - Add a category on presenter to handle video recorder stuff.






  - VideoRecorder unit test.
