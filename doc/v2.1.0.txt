General Notes
=============

The main goals of this release are:
- Make the videoRecorder and postProcessor more robust and eliminate some of the known failure modes.
- Dispatch all known errors in recorder, post processor and player to help with debugging for the next release.
- Notify user of errors in recording or playing.

Known remain problems not addressed in this release:
- AudioSession still not robust and can lead to potential recording problems including no sound and poor interaction with phone calls.

Next release:
- Analyze all dispatches from this release and address the errors as appropriate.
- Address audio session problems.


Fix #383
========

PROBLEMS
--------
1) If a user generates two (or more) videos in succession. If the second one starts recording before the first one has finished processing the first one may be destroyed.

2) Multiple videos are sent to the same friend in a row the final outgoing file may be overwritten before it has had a chance to be picked up by the FileTransfer manager. (This case is very unlikely and I have not seen it since the first thing the file transfer manager does is copy the file to a temporary outgoing file.)


CAUSE
-----
In the current architecture we use the same file for:
  - Recording: new.mov
  - Converted: newConverted.mp4
  - Outgoing per friend: outgoingVidToFriend<friendId>
These files may be overwritten when a new video is created before FileTransferManager has a chance to copy to temporary file.


WORKABLE ARCHITECTURE
---------------------
New OutgoingVideoUrl for each new recording
FriendId and VideoId are encoded in OutgoingVideoUrl
VideoProcessor is instantiated each time a recording completes to handle processing
All notifications are handled using NotificationCenter

Test cases: C2454


Fix #398
========

PROBLEM:
If the device is unable to generate a thumbnail it marks the video as failed permanently.


SOLUTION:
Always save friend.lastThumb for each friend. Use that one in case a new one fails.
- if friend.hasIncomingVideo of any kind
  - Always show a thumb
    - Try to get thumb from videos
    - Otherwise friend.lastThumb
    - Otherwise defaultThumb
    - Handle legacy thumbs for version update.
- Only if not incoming video of any kind show record button.

TEST CASES:
C2437, C2439, C2440, C2456


Fix #399
========
Additional params in dispatch for os_version, device_model, zazo_version, zazo_version_number


Fix - Dispatch messages for problems in video recorder setup.
=============================================================
- initCaptureSession
  - OB_ERROR(@"Cannot set AVCaptureSessionPresetLow");
- initVideoInput
  - DeviceHandler.getAvailableFrontVideoInputWithError
    OB_ERROR(@"VideoRecorder#initVideoInput Unable to get camera (%@)", Device has no camera);
    OB_ERROR(@"VideoRecorder#initVideoInput Unable to get camera (%@)", Error from AVCaptureDeviceInput deviceInputWithDevice:device);
- initCaptureOutput
  - OB_ERROR(@"VideoRecorder#initCaptureOutput: addCaptureOutputWithError: Could not add captureOutput");
- addAudioInput
  - OB_ERROR(@"VideoRecorder#addAudioInput Unable to get microphone: %@", Device has no microphone);
  - OB_ERROR(@"VideoRecorder#addAudioInput Unable to get microphone: %@", AVCaptureDeviceInput deviceInputWithDevice);

TEST CASES:
All error paths were tested by Sani as they are hard to exercise by a tester without access to the source.
